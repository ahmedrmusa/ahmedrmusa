### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a life-long learner, love to tinker with technology & currently working on providing technical operational services for financial and education industries. I help admins and developers with application development, data analytics and IT infrastructure management for a network of schools throughout New York City. In my previous roles, I have managed and maintained technology stacks of high-performance research clusters and enterprise applications. I possess expertise in performance tuning and have served as the go-to escalation point for troubleshooting and effectively communicating critical incidents to organizational leaders.
